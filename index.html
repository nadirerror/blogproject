        <h1>About Me</h1>
<p>
        I am a student who is eager to gain knowledge and to provide myself a positive platform for my future ambitions. I am a co-operative, confident and outgoing person. I have a good sense of humour and communicate well with people in a mature and respectful way, allowing me to build a good chemistry with the people I work alongside with. I work effectively on my own or as part of a team. Furthermore, I work to the best of my ability and can maintain high standards of work under pressure.

        The reason i came to code nation was because I had to experience the developing side of technology and also gain more knowledge in developing apps
