        <h1>Describing the purpose of IT in modern business</h1>
        
        <p>
            The purpose IT systems give companies a competitive edge, enabling them to enter larger markets and expand products or service lines more efficiently, as well as keep tabs on competitors. IT has now become such a pervasive aspect of business operations that many employees and managers no longer see it as a separate function. Rather, IT has become an indispensable element of every corporate department and function, driving innovation and fostering growth throughout the entire organization.
            Information technology in business helps a corporation maintain a watchful eye on expenses and profits, enabling management to act more nimbly to trim costs or to change the sales team’s focus when necessary. A strong IT system also helps all facets of a company work more productively. By enabling automation and digital tools, tasks that once took hours can now be performed in a matter of minutes. Today’s agile businesses weave IT into everything they do, enabling them to accomplish more in a shorter amount of time.
            <br>
            Businesses utilize IT in a number of different contexts and for many different purposes. In other words, IT isn’t just computers. For example, telephones, radio equipment and VOIP services used for vocal communications are included under the IT umbrella. In the same way, peripherals such as printers, copiers, scanners and 3D printers are also considered part of a business’ IT systems.
            When most people think IT, they think of computers: desktop machines, laptops and mobile devices used by individuals to input and manipulate data, create digital documents, conduct research, and more. IT also includes the applications and executable programs that are installed on these devices to enable the user to complete the task at hand. Somewhat less obviously, IT may also include the costs associated with purchasing, configuring and maintaining the necessary hardware and equipment to keep the company’s IT systems operating smoothly. In these ways, IT has become critical to the global business community.

        <h2>Describing methods, skills and resources needed to complete digital projects successfully </h2>
        
        <P>
            Research
        
            Planning out the process of my research by using search engines, E books, books, technique. To do this, identify where you are starting from in terms of your knowledge and resources (i.e. Point A), and identify where you want to go with your project 
            (Point B). 
            Make a list of all of the things missing between Point A and Point B and make a plan for filling in this gap
            
            Timing 
            
            Completing a successful project requires a significant amount of time and work, which means evaluating your priorities and planning your course of action. 
            Schedule specific research time and plan daily, weekly, or monthly targets for your progress (e.g. completing a detailed project outline by the first week).]
        </P>
        
        <h3>Plan and carry out tasks using IT – e.g. making your website. How will you plan it? Include a link to your troll board. </h3>







        <h1>Describe the risks that might impact digital projects – what causes digital projects to fail? Why? </h1>
        Misalignment with business processes: Marketing may build a beautiful new website with a great user experience, but if they overlook the resulting impacts on the company’s business processes, the initiative is very likely to fail. This often happens when teams put technology ahead of strategy, falling for the hype of new innovative tools before considering the business process implications of the new technology. Aligning digital and business goals and integrating new products seamlessly with business operations is critical to project success.

<p>
        Lack of cross-functional expertise: Similar to number 1 
        there’s a common misconception that digital projects only need “digital people.” 
        But every digital project should have someone with business process management skills
        to help scope and plan the alignment between the customer journey and back-end operational processes.
    </p>
        
        Limited digital strategy. Many digital projects are focused solely on the objective of one department or initiative
        rather than contributing to the overall company’s digital strategy and business goals. 
        Define specifically what success looks like for the project and how it contributes to the company’s business strategy before moving forward.
        <br>
        <br>
        Fixed plans that don’t account for change: The notion of a “5-year-plan” is dead. 
        Using Agile iterative process that allow for frequent tweaks and improvement is the only way to ensure that success is lasting. 
        Your digital project plans should be flexible enough to reflect business changes within the company and the market at any given moment. 
</br>
        <br>
        Overambition: Expecting perfection instead of embracing the “done is better than perfect” mantra tends to result in projects that drag on way past their scope. 
        Explore the idea of releasing “Minimum Viable Products,” or early versions of software that gauge how the market will respond and determine if the concept is worth pursuing. 
        Saying "Let’s launch a perfect site within the next 3 months” without a real business plan is a sure path to failure.
        The most common project risks are: Cost risk, typically escalation of project costs due to poor cost estimating accuracy and scope creep. 
        Schedule risk, the risk that activities will take longer than expected.

        <h1>Describe how you would go about selecting and using IT systems and software</h1>

        <p> When launching a company, just start moving. Tools can be distracting and they can wait; your first priority should be building, selling, and promoting your core product. 
            That's the most important tip we've heard from founders. If you're in the business of selling something, Don't spend too much time waiting around to get the perfect infrastructure set up. Just sell. 
            It's crucial to limit distraction when you're getting started—and while software can be a valuable tool, it can also be a distraction. 
            “There are so many tools out there, the tricky thing is to manage them all, It’s nice to have tools, but sometimes we have feature creep when we’re using too many things.
            Takeaway Apps are only tools to help you get stuff done. Try to make due with what you have for as long as you have, and only get new apps when you really need them.
