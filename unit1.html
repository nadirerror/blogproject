<h1>1.1 Describing the purpose of IT in modern business</h1>

<p>
    The purpose IT systems give companies a competitive edge, enabling them to enter larger markets and expand products or service lines more efficiently, as well as keep tabs on competitors. IT has now become such a pervasive aspect of business operations that many employees and managers no longer see it as a separate function. Rather, IT has become an indispensable element of every corporate department and function, driving innovation and fostering growth throughout the entire organization.
    Information technology in business helps a corporation maintain a watchful eye on expenses and profits, enabling management to act more nimbly to trim costs or to change the sales team’s focus when necessary. A strong IT system also helps all facets of a company work more productively. By enabling automation and digital tools, tasks that once took hours can now be performed in a matter of minutes. Today’s agile businesses weave IT into everything they do, enabling them to accomplish more in a shorter amount of time.
    <br>
    Businesses utilize IT in a number of different contexts and for many different purposes. In other words, IT isn’t just computers. For example, telephones, radio equipment and VOIP services used for vocal communications are included under the IT umbrella. In the same way, peripherals such as printers, copiers, scanners and 3D printers are also considered part of a business’ IT systems.
    When most people think IT, they think of computers: desktop machines, laptops and mobile devices used by individuals to input and manipulate data, create digital documents, conduct research, and more. IT also includes the applications and executable programs that are installed on these devices to enable the user to complete the task at hand. Somewhat less obviously, IT may also include the costs associated with purchasing, configuring and maintaining the necessary hardware and equipment to keep the company’s IT systems operating smoothly. In these ways, IT has become critical to the global business community.

<h2>Describing methods, skills and resources needed to complete digital projects successfully </h2>

<P>
    Research

    Planning out the process of my research by using search engines, E books, books, technique. To do this, identify where you are starting from in terms of your knowledge and resources (i.e. Point A), and identify where you want to go with your project 
    (Point B). 
    Make a list of all of the things missing between Point A and Point B and make a plan for filling in this gap
    
    Timing 
    
    Completing a successful project requires a significant amount of time and work, which means evaluating your priorities and planning your course of action. 
    Schedule specific research time and plan daily, weekly, or monthly targets for your progress (e.g. completing a detailed project outline by the first week).]
</P>

<h3>Plan and carry out tasks using IT – e.g. making your website. How will you plan it? Include a link to your troll board. </h3>







<h1>Describe the risks that might impact digital projects – what causes digital projects to fail? Why? </h1>
<p>
Misalignment with business processes: Marketing may build a beautiful new website with a great user experience, but if they overlook the resulting impacts on the company’s business processes, the initiative is very likely to fail. This often happens when teams put technology ahead of strategy, falling for the hype of new innovative tools before considering the business process implications of the new technology. Aligning digital and business goals and integrating new products seamlessly with business operations is critical to project success.
</p>

<p>
Lack of cross-functional expertise: Similar to number 1 
there’s a common misconception that digital projects only need “digital people.” 
But every digital project should have someone with business process management skills
to help scope and plan the alignment between the customer journey and back-end operational processes.
</p>

Limited digital strategy. Many digital projects are focused solely on the objective of one department or initiative
rather than contributing to the overall company’s digital strategy and business goals. 
Define specifically what success looks like for the project and how it contributes to the company’s business strategy before moving forward.
<br>
<br>
Fixed plans that don’t account for change: The notion of a “5-year-plan” is dead. 
Using Agile iterative process that allow for frequent tweaks and improvement is the only way to ensure that success is lasting. 
Your digital project plans should be flexible enough to reflect business changes within the company and the market at any given moment. 

<br>
Overambition: Expecting perfection instead of embracing the “done is better than perfect” mantra tends to result in projects that drag on way past their scope. 
Explore the idea of releasing “Minimum Viable Products,” or early versions of software that gauge how the market will respond and determine if the concept is worth pursuing. 
Saying "Let’s launch a perfect site within the next 3 months” without a real business plan is a sure path to failure.
The most common project risks are: Cost risk, typically escalation of project costs due to poor cost estimating accuracy and scope creep. 
Schedule risk, the risk that activities will take longer than expected.

<h2>Describe how you would go about selecting and using IT systems and software</h2>

<p> When launching a company, just start moving. Tools can be distracting and they can wait; your first priority should be building, selling, and promoting your core product. 
    That's the most important tip we've heard from founders. If you're in the business of selling something, Don't spend too much time waiting around to get the perfect infrastructure set up. Just sell. 
    It's crucial to limit distraction when you're getting started—and while software can be a valuable tool, it can also be a distraction. 
    “There are so many tools out there, the tricky thing is to manage them all, It’s nice to have tools, but sometimes we have feature creep when we’re using too many things.
    Takeaway Apps are only tools to help you get stuff done. Try to make due with what you have for as long as you have, and only get new apps when you really need them.
</p>

<h2>1.6  Describe and provide analysis on how your chosen technologies have helped you achieve your outcomes. </h2>
<p>

In my last project I used Trello it a Kanban system for project and task management. ... Similarly, Trello uses boards, lists, and cards to create a simpler visual system of project management. 
These 3 basic elements of the app provide a visual layout of your work for high-level decision-making and ground-level action-taking.
it's a terrific tool for project management and task management. The visual Kanban boards are flexible, shareable, and let you pack a ton of detail into each card. 
But Trello isn't just for work. 
You can use it to organize just about anything from 5 aside football to going out to dinner with family.

</p>



<h2>1.7 Describe legal guidelines and constraints that impact digital projects</h2>


<p>
There are significant legal constraints on the uploading and downloading of software and other digital content, including music and videos. 
Many items are copyright and can incorporate digital rights management, such as restricting the number of times a media file can be copied or converted to another format. When you buy software, you will  normally receive a licence to use it. 
You do not own the software itself, nor do you have the right to copy it. 
Some types of licence, including freeware and shareware impose fewer restrictions.
Legal constraints on online behaviour include protection of children legislation which prohibits grooming and inappropriate behaviour towards minors. 
You should ensure that you are familiar with the rules of “netiquette” which describes the recommended conduct of users in various online environments. 
Remember that libellous behaviour is subject to the same restrictions (and penalties) whether it is online or offline.
You should always ensure that you observe the correct guidelines and procedures for safe use of the Internet. 
It is not sufficient to know about guidelines and procedures – you must apply these when you are online.
</p>

<h2>Outcome 2</h2>

<h3>2.1 Review the ongoing use of IT tools and change approach as needed – in making your own website, are you happy with the tools you used? </h3>
<p>

The IT tools that I have used so far has been very helpful in making my website 
To Look better. the introduction of CSS has given me a variety of options so that I can choose formats such as text, font size, colours, borders and headers has made my website better to look at and seem more professional.

</p>

<h3>
2.2 Describe whether the IT tools selected were appropriate 
</h3>

<p>
The IT tools that i used were very appropriate it fitted my website

Visual studio code 
<br>
Visual studio code was the program that i used to build my website all coding for was on done on there it was simple to use 
<br>
Google 
<br>
I used google for most of my research from getting information on my content,references and understanding the programs i was using such as visual studio code  
<br>

Youtube
<br>
I also used youtube as part of my research watching tutorials on how to use trello and visual studio code.it made a lot more easier building my website by receiving information through videos  
</p>

<h3>2.3 Assess the strengths and weaknesses of your final project. </h3>

<p>
Strengths 
<br>
Easy to understand 
<br>
Easy to access
<br>
Useful and relevant content
<br>
Intuitive navigation and search
<br>
Quick and easy checkout process
<br>
Responsive design
<br>

Should have better grammar <br>
Confusing structure and navigation<br>
Cumbersome and lengthy checkout process<br>
Lack of mobile support<br>
</p>

<h3>2.4 Describe further improvements you can make to your project </h3>
<p>
Make your website mobile friendly.
Mobile friendly and easily accessible for all mobile devices. So anyone access it from any device.
Use long tail keyword 
To your target geographic location. It will help me with local search engine visibility and also helps you to reach your target audience. For example, if anyone search for my website it’ll be  top 10 links that come up on google.
Share  content on different social media channels
Share my website on my social media this marketing tactic will help my website to be visited a lot more and shared.
Use engaging and relevant images

To make my website better I could've used more images that matched my content so it could be more pleasing on the eyes of my audience. 
</p>

<h3>
2.5 Review outcomes to make sure they match requirements and are fit for purpose </h3>
<p>
There were a few requirements that needed to be followed in order for the project to be fit for purpose. Making sure that there was appropriate content for the website and collecting  information for it was one of them. I executed this effectively and left it prepared in google docs before building as it has the ability to do spelling and grammar checks on the content before pasting it into Visual Studio Code. Another requirement that needed to be followed was at the end of the project making sure that all of the pages did not have any errors. This was important because it can affect the way the website works. I have executed QA testing throughout the website to ensure no user journeys are interrupted and the code is functioning as desired.
</p>
<h2>Unit 1 - Outcome 3 </h2>
<h3> Unit- 3.1 Review the benefits and drawbacks of IT tools and systems used in terms of productivity and efficiency – could you have been more efficient when making your website? How? Could you have done it in teams? </h3>
<P>

As I mentioned earlier, below are the IT tools used within this project, they have been assessed based on how well they work within this project.<br>
 
Trello - Trello lets you work more collaboratively and get more done. It’s boards, lists, and cards enable you to organize and prioritize your projects in a fun, flexible, and rewarding way. [4] it is a terrific tool for project management and task management. The visual Kanban boards are flexible, shareable, and let you pack a ton of detail into each card. However it isn't just for work, you can use it to organize just about anything. [5] The disadvantage of Trello is I could not set a date as to when the tasks have to be done by which made it harder to make sure the project stays on track with how much time was remaining.<br>
 
Github - GitHub is a hosting service for Git repositories, it is the service for projects that use Git. [6] Almost every developer working on a group project or individually uses GitHub as most important tool due to its capability of making version control easier. GitHub provides developers an essential tool which helps in best code practices, on the other hand it does help in showcasing your recent work also. [8] The disadvantage of Github is it  does not have the ability to edit within the tool.<br>
Visual Studio Code - Visual Studio Code allows for improved efficiency through smart tools such as finishing off lines of code and readability. Efficiency could be improved through having a live area that updates the finished product as the code is written.

</P>

<h2> 3.2  Describe ways to improve productivity and efficiency </h2>
<p>
There are many ways in which productivity and efficiency can be improved within any project. They can be affected in a number of ways:<br>
distractions<br>
The level of planning<br>
The level of knowledge<br>
The effectiveness of IT tools<br>
However some of these ways can be controlled, for example the level of planning. Also you can’t always predict what obstacles may arise through the lack of knowledge and if you can quickly figure them out. It is important to construct a successful plan to improve productivity and efficiency.

</p>
<h3> 3.3  Develop solutions to improve own productivity using IT in digital projects – what would you do differently next time? Team work? Use of Slack? </h3>
<p>
It is important to identify issues before developing solutions for them, below i have stated certain issues and how to overcome them:
<br>
Lack of knowledge - This can be resolved by using different IT tools, like online tutorials. Also by bouncing ideas off other members of the group in order to find the best solution.
The time taken to write certain code - Repeating code will help you to lower the time spent and therefore increase efficiency.
The time taken to write content - This can be resolved by splitting content within a team of people to improve efficiency.
 
</p>
 
<h3>3.4 Describe how you would go about testing digital solutions </h3>
<p>
I would go about testing digital solutions by firstly assessing the effectiveness of them. I would consider:<br>
How easy or difficult it is to use <br>
Speed<br>
Cost<br>
The quality of the final product<br>

I would test these by researching experience’s of other people with a range of tools. This would help to give a widespread overview of the advantages and disadvantages for each of the tools. However the best way to determine whether the tools are efficient enough is to test them out yourself, this is because the UI may be easier or more complex for one to use than others.
