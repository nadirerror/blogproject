   <h1>Unit 2 </h1>
   <h2>
   Unit 2 - Outcome 1 - 1.1 Describing the content and layout for each page
</h2>
<p>
   Upon opening the website the user is greeted with a large white coloured banner, with the text “Welcome to my blog”, the top of the page holds the menu, which helps the user navigate between pages, the consistencies here will be seen in the way content is presented, the background colour and the menu style on each page, 
   Upon clicking the blog page, the user is met with another menu bar, the options here being to choose “unit 1”, “unit 2” and ”references”. <br>
   Clicking unit 1 will bring the user to the page where the questions for unit 1 have been attempted, the font chosen was ‘noto sans JP’, which was appropriately coloured black so that the user could easily read the content, in the top left corner there is also an image, there are also screenshots of how my website looks in different browsers, such as Google Chrome and firefox. Moving further down the page the user then gains access to my trello board via link, upon clicking this link, a new tab will open with the requested page, which allows the user to, when the trello board is inspected, go back to where they had left off reading. 
   This link feature should be consistent throughout my site.<br>
   Where i could improve would be helping the user with a simple option transition between my blog pages where most of the content is.

    <h2>1.6 Describing access issues that need taking into account - describe issues that people with disabilities may face when using webpages and how we can overcome them </h2> 
     <p></p>
    "It's difficult, if not impossible, to design generically for all disabilities," Wasserman says. "Within the main categories of disability — sensory, physical and cognitive — there is such wide variation, so it's important to understand your users first."
    If you try to get a physical read on how someone with disabilities actually goes online.Watch how people interact with the web, through assistive technologies like screen readers, or how they customize their browser,"
